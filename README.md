# fridge
smart fridge using object detection
This project implements a Smart Fridge system that uses Object Detection to automatically identify and manage food items inside a refrigerator. The goal is to minimize food waste, track inventory, and improve the convenience of everyday kitchen tasks. It can see what's inside, know whatâ€™s running low, and remind you before your food expires.
It uses technology such as
Python (core logic)
YOLO (object detection)
OpenCV (image processing)
TensorFlow / PyTorch
